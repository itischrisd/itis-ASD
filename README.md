  ASD (Algorithms and Data Structures)
</h1>

Repository that contains solutions to the exercises, as well as some additional implementations and analysis for the sake of exam revision, for the ASD (Algorithms and Data Structures) practical classes, taught by Stanis≈Çaw Horawa during studies on [PJAIT](https://www.pja.edu.pl/en/).

If you need some help, notice any bugs or come up with possible improvements, feel free to reach out to me and/or create a pull request. Keep in mind that some code may not be well optimized, as algorithm implamantation had to follow the variants presented during subject's lectures. Most tree strctures have objective implementation (excluding Binary Heap, which uses classic array) for the sake of more human readable logic. In such cases traversing and node lookup time complexity might not follow the real implemantation, but rather skip over it and assume best-case variants.
